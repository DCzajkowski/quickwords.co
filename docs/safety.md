# Is Quickwords safe to use?
Quickwords registers all global keyboard events, so it has an access to everything you type on the system. No data is saved in storage, and only 20 last keystrokes by default are remembered in the memory of the app. All your data should be secure. If you have any concerns about your privacy, contact us on [GitHub](https://github.com/quickwords/quickwords) or mention [@quickwordsapp](http://twitter.com/quickwordsapp) on Twitter.

If you discover a security vulnerability within Quickwords, please DM [@quickwordsapp](https://twitter.com/quickwordsapp). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
